# Combinations and Permutations counting problems
Given an input array and a target value , the possible type of problems that we face are listed below.
      Array              restriction       output 
1) distinct elements + taken only once + Combinations ( combination sum - 3 )
2) Distinct elements + taken any times + Combinations ( coin combinations - 2 , combination sum - 1 )
3) Distinct elements + taken only once + Permutations  
4) Distinct elements + taken any times + Permutations ( combination sum - 4 , coin combinations - 1 )
5) Repetition of elements + taken only once + Combinations ( combination sum - 2 )
6) Repetition of elements + taken any times + Combinations 
7) Repetition of elements + taken only once + Permutations
